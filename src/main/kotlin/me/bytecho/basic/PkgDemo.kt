/*The import keyword is not restricted to importing classes; you can also use it to import other declarations:
top-level functions and properties;
functions and properties declared in
object declarations;
enum constants*/

/*Unlike Java, Kotlin does not have a separate "import static" syntax; all of these declarations are imported using the regular
import keyword*/

/*If a top-level declaration is marked private, it is private to the file it's declared in */
